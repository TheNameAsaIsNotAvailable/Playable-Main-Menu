# 'Playable Main Menu' (2021)
A mod for Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven (2002).

This replaces the tutorial mission and the Colt 1911 model (plus rw_data.DLL, if needed). Thanks to Mr Robville for help with model axes and to Zaklaus for testing. This is 95% faithful to the original scene, but some elements had to be reconstructed to make it function as playable.
